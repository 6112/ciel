# Ciel

Ciel is a syntax highlighter for the web. It parses code inside the designated
HTML tags, and gives parts of the code special CSS classes used for coloring
the code.

Languages can be added by altering the `languages` variable in `ciel.js`.

Other themes can be added by creating CSS similar to the one in
`ciel-monokai.css`.

The full description for this module can be read by opening index.html in a web
